# The Street View House Numbers: Neural Networks Project
# Data Description: 
# The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset 
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object
recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes 
from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and 
numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in 
Google Street View images.

# Objective: 
The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image 
classification pipeline based on a deep neural network.
